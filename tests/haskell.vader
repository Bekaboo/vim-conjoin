# Vader tests for quote joining with conjoin.
# Haskell uses ++ to concatenate strings and doesn't use line continuation.

Given haskell (A multiline string):
  x = "Hello,"
    ++ " World" ++
    "!"

Do (Join with J):
  J

Expect haskell:
  x = "Hello, World" ++
    "!"


Given haskell (Function call with invalid strings):
  fun(
    'Hello,'
    ++ ' World!'
    )

Do (Join with count gJ):
  4gJ

Expect haskell:
  fun(  'Hello,'  ++ ' World!'  )
