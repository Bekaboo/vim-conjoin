# Vader tests for line continuation joining with conjoin.
# m4 uses an empty dnl comment to prevent outputting a newline.
# conjoin will delete that dnl when joining, but leaves non-empty
# comments in place.
# Test basic functionality; more coverage in shell.vader.

Given m4 (A comment mix):
  foo(1)dnl
  dnl
  bar(3)dnl
  baz(4)dnl comment
  qux(5)dnl
  morednl
  end(7)dnl

Do (Join everything with gJ):

Expect m4:
  foo(1)bar(3)baz(4)dnl commentqux(5)morednlend(7)dnl
