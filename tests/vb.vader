# Vader tests for line continuation joining with conjoin.
# Visual Basic uses (space-prefixed) underscore line continuation

# Test basic functionality; more coverage in shell.vader.

Given vb (A Visual Basic function with continuation):

Given vb (A long comment with underscores at the end):
  ' conjoin doesn't treat _
  ' comment _blocks_ specially
  ' this is perhaps a bug_
