# Vader tests for line continuation joining with conjoin.
# Modern Fortran uses ampersand at the end of a line to continue.
# A leading (optionally space-leading) ampersand on the next line is also
# allowed.  conjoin does not support column 6 as a continuation indicator.
# Fortran uses // for string concatenation.
# Test basic functionality; more coverage in shell.vader.

Given fortran (Line with continuations):
  i = 1 &
  & + 2 &
    + 3
  print *, i, ' B&W'

Do (Join all four lines):
  4J

Expect fortran:
  i = 1 + 2 + 3 print *, i, ' B&W'


Given fortran (Line with continuations, line 2 has trailing space):
        i = 1&
       &+ 2   & 
  label + 3
        print *, i, ' B&W'

Do (Join all lines with visual gJ):
  VGgJ

Expect fortran:
        i = 1+ 2   label + 3      print *, i, ' B&W'


Given fortran (Program with continuations):
  program myprog
  integer :: i
  
        i =&
  label&1 +&
        2 +&
        3
  print write (*,*) 'i is ',    &    
       &i, ' and I am ',&
  ! a comment

Execute (Join the two expressions with :Join):
  4,7Join
  +
  Join 3

Expect fortran:
# Big space in last line because :join doesn't trim trailing space
  program myprog
  integer :: i
  
        i = label&1 + 2 + 3
  print write (*,*) 'i is ',    i, ' and I am ', ! a comment


Given fortran (A multi-line string):
  print *,s "Hello, " &
    & // "World"//
    "!"

Do (Join with count J):
  3J

Expect fortran:
  print *,s "Hello, World!"
