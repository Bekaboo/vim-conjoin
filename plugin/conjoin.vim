" File: conjoin.vim
" Author: Trevor Stone
" Description: Plugin which maps J and gJ to remove line continuation
" characters when joining lines.  Works with J/gJ alone, with a count, or in
" visual mode.  Also provides a :[range]Join[!] command.

""
" @section Introduction, intro
" @order intro commands mappings config functions
" conjoin is a plugin that handles line joining in the presence of line
" continuation characters.  Vim's normal behavior for |J| and |:join| on the
" following shell script: >
"   cat file.txt \
"     | sort \
"     | uniq -c
" <
" leaves the backslash continuation characters in place: >
"   cat file.txt \ | sort \ | uniq -c
" <
" With conjoin, running join commands on the same script will produce >
"   cat file.txt | sort | uniq -c
" <
" Note that vim already removes leading comment characters when joining lines
" in a block comment.
"
" conjoin works with several programming languages by default, see
" @section(config) for details.

""
" @section Mappings, mappings
" J  Join [count] lines, as with the builtin |J| command.  Before joining
" lines, trailing and/or leading continuation escape characters will be
" removed from the lines to be joined.
"
" {Visual}J  Join the highlighted lines, as with the builtin |v_J| command.
" Before joining lines, trailing and/or leading continuation escape characters
" will be removed from the lines to be joined.
"
" gJ  Like J but with joining semantics like the builtin |gJ|.
"
" {Visual}gJ  Like J but with joining semantics like the builtin |v_gJ|.

" @section Configuration, config
" g:conjoin_filetypes configures continuation patterns for many programming
" lanugages.  It is a dict with filetypes (e.g. "sh", "ruby", "vim") as keys
" and conjoin pattern dicts as values.  A conjoin dict has optional "trailing"
" and "leading" keys mapped to regular expression patterns.  When conjoin
" mappings or functions are called, the current buffer's 'filetype' is looked
" up in g:conjoin_filetypes.  If it contains a conjoin dict, the "trailing"
" pattern will be matched against each join line (except the last) and the
" "leading" pattern will be matched against each join line (except the first).
" Make sure to include $ at the end of trailing patterns and ^ at the
" beginning of leading patterns.  Example use in .vimrc: >
"   if !exists('g:conjoin_filetypes')
"     let g:conjoin_filetypes = {}
"   endif
"   g:conjoin_filetypes.intercal = #{leading: '^\s*PLEASE', trailing: '\\$'}
" <
" A buffer-local variable b:conjoin_patterns can replace the global filetype
" settings.
"
" The default set of configured filetypes is >
"   autoit bash c cobra context cpp csh fortran m4 mma plaintex ps1 python
"   ruby sh tcl tcsh tex texmf vb vim zsh

" Default continuation character information taken primarily from
" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(syntax)#Line_continuation
" Entries are ordered by the continuation pattern they use:
" Shell-style languages use a trailing backslash (\):
"   sh bash csh tcsh zsh c cpp python ruby tcl texmf
" Mathematica/Wolfram Language uses a trailing backslash or the special
" Unicode character F3B1 (ïŽ±):
"   mma
" PowerShell uses a trailing backtick preceeded by whitespace ( `):
"   ps1
" Visual Basic etc. use a trailing underscore preceeded by whitespace ( _):
"   autoit cobra vb
" Vim uses a leading backslash and optional space, :help line-continuation
"   vim
" Fortran 90+ uses a trailing ampersand and optionally a leading ampersand on
" the next line.  Note that this pattern doesn't require the & to be in column
" 6, nor does it handle other non-zero column 6 values.
"   fortran
" TeX treats an empty trailing comment (%) as a line continuation:
"   context plaintex tex
" m4 uses an empty trailing comment (dnl) to avoid outputting newline:
"   m4
